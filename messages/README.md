##### Reema Al-Marzoog
##### COMP 20 Lab 6
##### Due: March 12, 2015

###### Implemented correctly/incorrectly:
To my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly.

I did not collaborate or discuss the assignment with anyone.

###### Approx. hours spent:
1 hour

###### Is it possible to request the data from a different origin or from your local machine using XMLHttpRequest?
No; the data must be from the same origin for security reasons. If you were 
allowed to read data from other origins, you would be able to access data from 
other websites (potentially allowing you to maliciously access online bank 
account information from a bank's website, for example) and perform actions 
on those other websites through your website's JavaScript that you are not 
supposed to be able to. For example, if you had Facebook open in one tab and
Google open in another, Google would be able to post a Facebook status for you.
