    <h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Marauder's Map</h1>
    <p>Reema Al-Marzoog - April 24, 2015</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      My client, Dane Roberts, created a web application server that allows 
      users to send it their location in the form of a latitude and longitude 
      along with a unique identifier -- a login -- via a POST request. It 
      stores these logins along with the most recent location at which that 
      login checked in and the date of the check-in. When a successful request 
      is made, the server responds with a list of the check-ins in JSON format.
      These check-ins are also displayed on the home page. A single check-in can
      also be accessed in JSON format by passing the login as a parameter to
      the "/location.json" page.
    </p>
    <p>
      My client also used their server to create a "Marauder's Map". His 
      Marauder's Map is a web application that displays the location of the 
      current user (i.e., the one currently visiting the Marauder's Map website)
      marked by a special marker. It also displays the location of everyone else
      who has checked-in and their distance away from the current user. Both 
      Marauder's Map and its server were created for Tufts' COMP 20 course.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was hired to assess Marauder's Map and its server for privacy and 
      security vulnerabilities and to resolve these issues. 
      What follows is a list of the main issues I found, how I found them, 
      their severity, and how I resolved the issue.
    </p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>

      <p>
        I mainly used two tools to find the security and privacy issues: 
        PostMan and curl. PostMan is a Chrome plug-in that allows users to 
        send HTTP requests to specified URLs. I used it to send POST requests
        to my client's POST API, using parameters designed to exploit potential
        security and privacy weaknesses. Similarly, curl also allows users to
        send HTTP requests, but it does so through the command line and as a
        result is more flexible in some ways. I ran tests on the code both 
        locally so that I could gain further insight into the vulnerabilities
        through the server's error messages as well as on my client's live 
        sites to fully see the security pitfalls in action. I first ran 
        attacks without looking at the code, the way an actual malicious user
        would, and then I examined the code to see if I could find any more
        potential causes for concern.
      </p>

    <h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>

      <p>
        Given that these applications are (arguably) inherently questionable
        from a privacy point of view since they expose users' locations
        to any one who wants to see them (though of course the login need not
        be anything that could actually reveal the user's identity and the
        latitude and longitude can be falsified), most of the issues I found
        concerning were security-related. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the issues stemmed from the application's loose constraints
        on user input. The server application is overly trusting over user
        input; it does not sufficiently validate whether the data is present, 
        is in the correct format, and does not contain any malicious content.
        As a result, users can quite easily cause the server to crash or can
        add their own content to the site, allowing them to disrupt user 
        experience and even potentially coerce users into revealing sensitive
        information. Fortunately, now that these issues have been found, they
        can be quite easily resolved.
      </p>

    <h3>Issues Found and Technical Analysis</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Location:</span> The script is injected through the POST API at 
            drmmap.herokuapp.com/sendLocation and affects the GET API at 
            drmmap.herokuapp.com/
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Severity:</span> High. Through XSS, malicious 
            users can cause the site to malfunction, disrupting the user 
            experience for legitimate users. Malicious users can also gain 
            access to other users' cookies. They can also add links to malicious
            websites or forward users there. It can be used for phishing scams. 
            It can be used to render the web app completely unuseable by 
            executing a function an infinite number of times (e.g. putting a
            JavaScript <code>alert()</code> function in an infinite loop).
            There are a lot of ways this 
            vulnerability can be exploited, and it is very easy to do so.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Description:</span> This XSS vulnerability allows
            users to inject their own HTML or JavaScript into the database 
            by submitting it as part of the login parameter because the server 
            doesn't do anything to protect against code being inserted. Then, 
            every time the login gets rendered (on the server's home page, for 
            example), the HTML in the login gets rendered and if it includes 
            JavaScript, the JavaScript is run.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">How it was found:</span>
            <p>
              This issue was found by sending a POST request to the /sendLocation 
              route using the Google Chrome plugin PostMan. The login parameter
              was set to "&ltscript&gtalert("XSS")&ltscript&gt"
            </p>

              alt="PostMan request" /></div>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Proof of vulnerability:</span>

            <p>Now, when one visits "drmmap.herokuapp.com", the script is run. 
            In this case, that means that an alert pops up on the client's 
            browser, as seen below.</p>
            <div><img src="Screen Shot 2015-04-21 at 10.07.28 PM.png" 
              alt="Inserted script gets executed."></div>

            <p>Another side-effect is that the login for that entry shows up
            as blank once the alert is closed.</p>

              alt="Login displays as blank." class="smaller"></div>
          </li>

          <li>
          <span class="bold">Resolution:</span>
            To resolve this issue, user input should be 
            escaped before it is saved into the database. For example, convert
            the <code>&lt</code> in the input to <code>&amp;lt</code>. Rather
            than having a blacklist of characters, however, it is always a good
            idea to have a whitelist of allowable characters. You are more 
            likely to miss something with a blacklist. So, using regular
            expressions, convert special characters to their HTML codes and then
            filter the logins through a whitelist. If any code has already been
            injected, these database must also be searched and sanitized in the
            same way.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
       <h4>Server crashes on blank or malformed data</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Location:</span> POST API at "/sendLocation" 
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Severity:</span> Moderate to High. This 
            causes the app to completely crash, but it's arguably better
            than the vulnerabilities inherent in the previous issue discussed,
            XSS, which include phishing schemes, and it's easier to fix.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Description:</span> When a POST request is sent
            to "/sendLocation" and any of the parameters are malformed in some
            way, the server crashes. Malformed input I tested
            out include leaving one of the parameters completely blank and 
            adding an ampersand to the parameter list (e.g., 
            <code>curl --data "login=LogIn&amp;&amp;lng=3&amp;lat=3"
            drmmap.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code> -- note the extra ampersand
            between the login and the longitude parameter).
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">How it was found:</span> 
            <p>
              I used curl to try out differently formed inputs that I thought
              might cause a problem. The first to result in a server crash was
              when I left a parameter blank:
            </p>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Proof of vulnerability:</span>
            <p>The malformed input results in a server crash:</p>
            <img src="Screen Shot 2015-04-23 at 7.54.54 PM.png" alt="Server crashes on malformed input" class="smaller"/>

            <p>I ran the same curl command replacing localhost:3000 with 
              the actual website URL and it resulted in an application error:
            </p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Resolution:</span>
            <p> 
              Resolving this issue was 
              fairly simple. My client had code that checked whether a login,
              latitude parsed as a float, or longitude parsed as a float were
              null: 
            </p>

            <div><img src="Screen Shot 2015-04-23 at 10.52.54 PM.png" 
              alt="Snippet of client's source code that checks if params are null"
              class="smaller" />
            </div>

            <p>Unfortunately, however, this code was not enough to handle 
            malformed input. In fact, it did not handle the case where a user 
            passes in non-numerical input as the latitude or longitude, because 
            <code>parseFloat()</code> converts non-numeric input to 
            <code>NaN</code>, not to <code>null</code>. This was allowing
            non-numeric lat and lngs to be stored in the database.
            My fix for the former has the added benefit of fixing the latter. I 
            just changed the assertions to be more general, checking for 
            <code>undefined</code>, <code>NaN</code>, <code>null</code>, etc
            all in one. Now the server just returns
            the error message instead of crashing.

      <li>
        <h4>MongoDb request injection attack</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Location:</span> GET API at "/location.json"
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Severity:</span> Low. Currently, all that an attacker
            could do with this vulnerability is force the "/location.json" API to
            behave differently than it's supposed to, but the only additional 
            information it can get is information that's already publicly accessible. It
            can also cause an internal server error, but this does not shut down the whole
            site the way the previous issue did. If there were data in the database that
            was supposed to be private, I would be more concerned.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="bold">Description:</span>The code for "/location.json" does
            not check that the login passed in is a string, so a user can add a 
            MongoDb query to the request. FINISH THIS.

      <li>
        <h4>A non-security or privacy issue: Sorting of check-ins is not correct</h4>

        <p> This is not a security or privacy issue, so I won't detail it to the 
          same extent as the others, but it is a functionality issue.
        </p>

        <p>In the server's home page, check-ins are meant to be sorted by the date
          of the last check in. However, dates are currently generated by calling 
          the Javascript <code>Date()</code> function: <code>var created_at = Date();</code>.
          As a result, dates are of the form: "Thu Apr 23 2015 23:27:49 GMT-0400 (EDT)".
          To sort the dates, my client uses the following code:
          <code>coll.find({"login":user}).sort({created_at: -1}).toArray(function(err2, found){ 
          /* function body */ });</code>. Though this seems correct at first glance, 
          its results are not as intended: because of the format of the date, the
          dates are sorted in alphabetic order by day of the week, then month and so on, 
          which doesn't always correspond to chronological order. The easiest fix for 
          this is to use a different format for the dates and to leave the sorting code 
          as is: <code> var created_at = new Date(); created_at = created_at.toISOString();
          </code>. Note that any existing check-in's created_at fields will have to be
          converted to this date format.
        </p>
