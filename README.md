# comp20-ral-marzoog

What is the purpose of this Git repository?

>  To serve as a portfolio of code samples of projects I wrote during COMP 20. 
  It keeps all the work in one place, allows much of the code to be run live
  via gh-pages, and is kept under version-control.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

>  My favorite lab was the responsive design one. Responsive design is not 
  something I knew much about at all before this class, but it's so important
  for high-quality UI/UX, which in turn is extremely important because if your
  app is hard to use, no one's going to use it.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

>  FINISH THIS.
