# comp20-ral-marzoog

What is the purpose of this Git repository?

> To serve as a portfolio of code samples of projects I wrote during COMP 20. 
  It keeps all the work in one place, allows much of the code to be run live
  via gh-pages, and is kept under version-control.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

> My favorite lab was the responsive design one. Responsive design is not 
  something I knew much about at all before this class, but it's so important
  for high-quality UI/UX, which in turn is extremely important because if your
  app is hard to use, no one's going to use it.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

> Asynchronous programming. I had experience with JavaScript before this class,
  so I had some exposure to it, but I still was struggling for a while with A3 
  because I forgot to check that the status of my HTTP response was 200 and that
  the readyState was 4. I was trying it out in my console for a while beforehand
  and was confused as to why it worked there and not in my code until I realized
  that it was because I was forgetting about asynchronicity. And I forgot again 
  when I was doing the practice questions for Quiz 2. After getting it wrong a 
  second time, I feel like I've finally actually have a better understanding of 
  it.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

> I want to learn more about security.
